        "\n",
        "In [sheet 2.5](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/tutorials/02e-intro-to-hf.html), we already brushed over the distinction between pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, fine-tuning was introduced as the training LMs on *task-specific* datasets, e.g., for movie review generation or classification. For classification, LMs are usually fine-tuned with a classification head (see [sheet 3.2](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/tutorials/03b-transformers-heads-training.html) for a recap). However, from here on, we will focus on fine-tuning of model for *generative* tasks, i.e., simply fine-tuning LMs for next-word prediction on a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have seen fine-tuning of a generative LM for question answering in homework 1. Here, the specific task the model is supposed to learn is constituted by the specific dataset and the formatting of the questions and the answers. The model was trained on examples of questions with correct answers; i.e., this is *supervised fine-tuning* where the model was shown what the desired behavior is (i.e., which next tokens it is supposed to predict).\n",
        "\n",
        "For state-of-the-art LLMs, it has been identified that there is a particular kind of task that *general-purpose LLMs*, and in particular *assistants*, should be able to complete: namely, **instruction-following**. That is, rather than creating LMs that can only do QA on a specific dataset with a particular formatting, the community started to build *instruction-tuned* LLMs, which generate sensible outputs given user instructions ranging from \"Provide ten recipes with tofu in a bullet list format\" to \"Summarize the following scientific paper\".\n",
        "This has also been achieved with supervised fine-tuning, where the example input and output pairs in the dataset consist of example instructions, and their respective completions."

Use the following code to test the instruction-following performance of an instruction-tuned model (Qwen-2.5-7B) and a simple small LM (GPT-2). Feel free to play around with the decoding parameters! (**WARNING**: the instruction-tuned model is a large model, so it can take a moment to load on Colab. Please also be aware of it if you execute the notebook locally!)"

The assistant tutor model has to be finetuned such that it can have natural-sounding conversations with students on a range of subjects, i.e., we need dialogues from a teaching context as data for training. For the medical knowledge base, it is probably necessary to implement an integrated retrieval system that allows the language model to access the database, rather than just generating everything from next-token predictions. For writing abstracts of scientific papers, we have to optimise the model on summarisation, possibly already using scientific papers in the training.\n",

        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning is often introduced a separate type of machine learning, in addition to supervised and unsupervised learning. Reinforcement learning broadly defines the field of study and the methods for training agents to learn to take actions that (optimally) achieve a goal, based on experience in the environment. It can be seen as the computational formalization of trial-and-error learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difference to supervised learning is that the agent (the terms \"model\", \"LM\" and \"agent\" will be used interchangeably in this section) learns which actions are useful for achieving the goal itself, rather than being shown the \"ground truth\" optimal actions as in supervised learning. The task of the developer is, therefore, to correctly specify the goal, and the agent will \"discover\" a way to achieve it.\n",
        "In the formal framework which underpins RL (namely, MDPs), the goal is represented via the *reward function*. This function assigns high rewards to desired outcomes, and low rewards to undesired ones, therefore implicitly representing a goal.\n",
        "It is important to note that, in general, the approach of RL allows to specify what the developer want the agent to learn to do (i.e., the goal), but *not necessarily how*, exactly. Correct specification of the goal is a far from trivial task and a lot of current research goes into understanding how to specify these goals in the field of *alignment* (more on this in future sessions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using RL for fine-tuning LLMs is one of the main methodological innovations that seems to have led to the impressive performance of SOTA LLMs. In particular, RL allows to fine-tune LLMs towards human preferences and commericial usability, because its mechanics lend itself to training a model based on a more abstract signal whether an output is good or bad (i.e., let it discover how to generate output that recevies a \"good\" reward!), rather than based on particular demonstrations. This is especially useful because the objectives of fine-tuning of SOTA LLMs often include aspects that are very difficult to specify via specific demonstrations, like being *helpful, honest, harmless* ([Bai et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862)).\n",
        "To this end, instead of using supervised learning, *human feedback* can be used as a reward signal to fine-tune the model.\n",
        "This is why the fine-tuning technique in question  is called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, practical aspects of the core components of RLHF are discussed. These core components are (see [this](https://cdn.openai.com/instruction-following/draft-20220126f/methods.svg) figure for an overview):\n",
        "* the policy (i.e., the backbone LLM),\n",
        "* the supervised fine-tuning data (SFT) and training,\n",
        "* the reward modeling data and the resulting reward model,\n",
        "* and, finally the RL training objective (commonly, the PPO algorithm) and the dataset for fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",

For instance, Llama offers a suite of models where both the initial LM, i.e., the *base* model and the resulting fine-tuned model is provided. For Llama-2 ([Touvron et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288)), the paper provides some information about the details of the training and the architecture of the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under state-of-the-art models, usually LMs of at least >=1B parameters are used as policies for further fine-tuning. The intuitive reason is that RLHF is mostly used for creating more general-purpose assistants rather than task-specific models, and therefore, the initial model should have rather large capacity and perform well on a wide range of tasks (which, as we know, tends to come with [scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361)). In other words, the base model should be good -- otherwise: \"Garbage in, garbage out\" (i.e., it might be very difficult if not impossible to fix a bad base model through fine-tuning).\n",

        "\n",
        "While the specific methodological details might vary, the conceptual point behind SFT is two-fold: (1) models are often instruction-tuned for turning into actually useful assistants and (2) (more importantly) the model is \"nudged\" towards outputting human-demonstrated (and therefore, human-preferred) texts for the ultimate goal of the fine-tuning (e.g., being helpful, harmless, honest). This makes subsequent RL-tuning more efficient. Intuitively, this is because the space of actions (i.e., any possible completion, given a prompt!) which the agent has to explore is quite giagantic, and the agent might make quite a lot of errors before \"stumbling\" upon high-reward actions. Through SFT, the agent is already biased towards the higher-reward space of actions.\n",

The perhaps most intuitive one, as discussed in the lecture, is obtaining human feedback as the reward signal. Since having humans give online feedback to an LM for thousands of samples is costly and cumbersome, instead, a reward model is trained on human preferences. For training such a reward model, human annotations are collected. As discussed in the lecture, these annotations can take different forms.\n",

        "Specifically, the reward model is usually initialized from a pretrained LLM (maybe even the same one as the base LM of the policy), and fine-tuned with a specific *head* to output numerical scores. It is usually trained to maximize the difference in predicted scores scores $r$ between the preferred and the rejected answer in a pair. Formally, the model is trained with the following loss:\n",

Depedning on the model, sometimes the same dataset as for SFT used, sometimes a similar dataset with other inputs is used. Note that now the dataset doesn't need any labels, but only the inputs (i.e., initial \"states\") based on which the model will generate predictions (i.e., actions) which, in turn, will be assigned rewards (by the reward model which represents the environment).\n",

However, there is a core shared idea between PPO and other algorithms in the category of *policy-gradient* methods.\n",

Specifically, for a training step, we can sample actions, retrieve their log probability under the current policy, get rewards for these actions, and calculate weight updates based on the product of log probability and the reward.\n",
