BERT paper on the other hand, is easier to understand, uses a simple language, even starting from the Abstract. It shows and promotes model's performance results, based on many different experiments, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. It is strongly empirical.\n",

        "#### Model Architecture:\n",
        "Since Bengio paper is one of the first succesful Natural Language Models, it of course builds upon many mathematically-heavy theorems and proposals. Architecture is detailly explained , starting from the theoricial concept \"curse of dimensionality\" , and explains their solution (embedding) and one by one, context window, linear layers and the whole architecture in detail. It requires good sense of mathematics.In constrast to that, BERT is built upon already existing and largely adopted architecture, therefore it only explains key differences that it has over the other existing Transformer-based models. Thus, it is not mathematically heavy, but requires good knowledge on modern LM architecture.\n",

        "#### Training Objective / Loss\n",
        "Bengio paper includes heavy explanations of the core concepts such as log-likelihood, gradient descent, probability distributions, embeddings.BERT is,on the other hand, simpler since it uses adopted methods. It doesn't explain the mathematical background, rather provides citations, and focuses on Masked LM or NSP and give which loss type they used for this pre-training types.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Experiments\n",
        "Bengio uses a proof of concept while conducting two experiments on small datasets named Brown Corpus and AP Newsire. It has limited tasks in its experiments. BERT is in contrast, heavily relying on empirical results on a rich variety of experiments such as well-known benchmarks(GLUE, SQuAD) and downstream tasks. It has clear comparisions of quantitive results, also uses vast datasets named BooksCorpus and Wikipedia.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results and Discussion\n",
        "Bengio paper doesn't have that extensive quantitive results since it doesn't conduct extensive experiments, rather it uses its theoritical propositions and discusses its limitations.However, BERT, is in a sense promoting the model , focusing on performance gains, task-specific results and improvements, and then point out some limitations such as computing time and hyperparameters.\n",
